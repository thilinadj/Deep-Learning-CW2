### General Info
***
Image classifcation is a popular problem that is being solved and have many advances over the past few years. In this Given Task, some of the Deep learning Models are built from scratch and some Pretrained models are tested with Fashion-Minst Dataset,to compare the model's performances on the usecase.
***
The following models are being trained and tested for this use case:
* ANN
* CNN
* [ViT (based sized model)](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k)
* [BEiT(base-sized model)](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/beit-base-patch16-224-pt22k-ft22k)
* [Swin transformer(large sized model)](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/swin-base-patch4-window12-384-in22k)
* [MobileNet V2](https://huggingface.co/google/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224)
